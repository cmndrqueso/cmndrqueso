# 👋 Hi, my name is Andres Calzadias

My adventure starts with me trying to make my parents proud by becoming a lawyer. Along the way I discovered something:

I enjoy making elaborate multi-hour solutions to solve 5 minute inconveniences. While working through an assortment 
of legal work, I found myself doing repetative tasks and wondering if some of my work would be better off automated.
and so began my quest...

Now, in pursuit of my quest I may have gotten lost along the way 😁. 
I changed my degree, changed my career and begun learning Java, Python ,
Javascript in addition to React and Node.js. Welcome to my adventure do 
be careful, we uhm seem to get lost along the way.
